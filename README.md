# Cypress workshop

👋 hello! 

This repo contains a workshop to teach you about getting started with the Cypress testing framework (https://www.cypress.io/).

## System Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2 or greater
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) v10 or greater
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6 or greater

> If you do not have Node installed and are running on Mac or Linux, I advise the use of [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) 

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

## Setup

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rob212/cypress-workshop.git
$ cd cypress-workshop
```

## Running the code

Open up this repo in your favourite editor. Run `npm install` once to get the dependencies.
