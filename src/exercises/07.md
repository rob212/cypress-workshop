# Exercise 7 - Date Fields

We will continue on our happy path journey through to the final page of the goose sighting service, the 'Date saw goose' page.

### Exercise

Expand our `journey_test.cy.js` to continue by entering valid dates in the 'Date Saw Goose' page before continuing through the confirmation page.


The Goose Sighting application uses a GDS (Government Design System) Date input component. This comprises of three text fields (for accessibility reasons). 

Using your existing knowledge, populate these fields with a valid date entry.

Cypress does not have built in function to simulate the 'tab' key being pressed, so we need to use selectors for each text field. (There is a plugin to allow tab key to be simulted, but it's currently still in beta: https://github.com/kuceb/cypress-plugin-tab )

> If a site uses \<input type="date"> for date pickers then Cypress allows you to fill the date as one call to `cy.type('yyyy-mm-dd')`. Further info in the docs: https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type.html#Date-Inputs

You should move onto the 'check your answers' summary page. This page contains a typical summary of the information we have provided so far. For this workshop we will continue once more to progress to the final page of the service. Do so by using your knowledge to interact with the 'Continue' button in the summary page.
