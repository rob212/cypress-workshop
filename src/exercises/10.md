# Exercise 10 - Refactoring our journey test

Taking what you have just learned about the Cypress Testing Library, continue to refactor the remainder of our journey tests to utilise it.

### Exercise

Refactor the remainder of our journey tests replacing the `cy.get` calls with Cypress Testing Library calls that better reflect the service from the user's perspective.

> Hint:
> You can interact with text input elements based on their label text using cy.findByLabelText() and passing in a string representing the displayed label text.

## Running via the Command Line

So far we have run our tests via the Cypress Runner to help us visualise and debug what our tests are doing. To run the tests as part of a CI/CD pipeline, Cypress supports running via the command line. 

Try running `npm run cy:run` via your terminal. This command has already been configured in the `package.json` file. 

By default this will generate a video of our tests running and place them in the `cypress/videos` directory.
