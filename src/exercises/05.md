# Exercise 5 - Continuing the journey

We will continue on our happy path journey through the goose sighting serivce on the 'Geese Liked' page which contains radio input elements.


 ### Exercise

Expand our `journey_test.cy.js` to continue by selecting a valid radio input and continuing.

The `check` function can be used to select a radio input element.

Notice unlike Selenium, Cypress handles waits for us automatically. Each element is given a maximum of 4 seconds to appear by default before Cypress fails the test.

Finally, progress our journey test onto the next stage by having Cypress click on the 'Continue' button.
