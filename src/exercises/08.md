# Exercise 8 - Completing the journey

Now we are on the final page of the happy path journey we assert that is have successfully completed.


 ### Exercise

So far we have been relying on Cypress automatically failing our journey test if it is not able to complete any of our steps. Now on our final page we will specify some explicit assertions to confirm the journey completed successfully. 

We will do this via the `cy.contains` function that verifies the presence of a substring on the page. Note that contains can also match regular expressions.

> You can also use Chai chainer assertions in addition to Sinon-Chai. They are out of scope for this workshop. More information can be found under the docs: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions.html

Expand our `journey_test.cy.js` by asserting the valid completion of our journey via the presence of a success message.

`cy.contains('GOOSE RECORDED');`

### Extra challenge 

If you are familiar with regular expressions try to assert that our summary page contains a reference number that matches the valid format of 3 upper case letters, 4 numbers followed by a single uppercase letter.
