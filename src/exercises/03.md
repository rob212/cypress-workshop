# Exercise 3 - A failing test

### Debugging a test in the Cypress runner

Cypress strives to always provde meaningful failure messages.

We are going to purposefully break our visit assertion to see how the Cypress runner reports it.


### Exercise

In our `journey_test.cy.js` file, invalidate the URL and watch as the Cypress runner automatically updates as soon as you save the file.

Once you have had a chance to inspect the error message, correct the url once more to result in a passing test.
