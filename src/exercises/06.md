# Exercise 6 - Text inputs

We will continue on our happy path journey through the goose sighting serivce on the 'Geese Type' page which contains a text input.


 ### Exercise

Expand our `journey_test.spec.js` to continue by selecting the goose type text input field and entering a valid entry. 

The `type` function can be used to input a text string into a selected element. 

Instead of clicking on the 'continue' link you are able to simulate the user clicking the enter key on their keyboard. This is done with the addition of a literal {<command>} within the type string argument:

`cy.get('#goose-type').type('<input text> {enter}');`

More options are available via the Cypress docs: https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type.html#Arguments
